Yes, but that's just a limitation of the chip. I'm not a driver guy,
but I'd expect the driver to do whatever is need, in software, to fix
such limitations.

Yes, we shouldn't have to check the destination MAC address in all
ethertype handlers. The Ethernet layer has to do its job.

But looking at the openwrt code, it seems that the driver properly
calls eth_type_trans(). So skb->pkt_type should be correctly set and we
could use it to know if the frame was for us. It'd still be good to
verify that skb->pkt_type == PACKET_OTHERHOST when the original problem
happens.

Testing if ->pkt_type == PACKET_HOST in the PPPoE discovery handler
would be a good thing anyway, to avoid processing packets just because
someone started tcpdump. That might also "fix" David's problem as a
side effect.
