I'd also suspect that the peer just sent a PADT. That can be
intentional. Some providers proactively force reconnections
every x days. Though 20 hours looks like a really low timeout.
You can capture PPPoE discovery packets with
"tcpdump -i nic-eth1.3902 pppoed".

Another possibility is that the network interface is modified
(interface passed down, MTU or the MAC address changed) while the
PPPoE session is established.

I didn't know about that implementation. PPPoE has been implemented
using PPPOX sockets since at least the beginning of the git history.
