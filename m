From what I remember of the rp-pppoe and pppd code, once the PPPoE
session is established, rp-pppoe gives control to pppd.
Therefore it has no chance to receive a PADT, since it can't read the
file descriptor used for PPPoE discovery anymore.

That means that the kernel needs to have some ugly code to snoop PADT
messages and kill the affected channel, so that pppd terminates without
waiting for an LCP time out.

What's certain, is that the kernel will shut down the PPP channel
attached to a PPPoE session that receives a PADT. Matching is done on
the source MAC address, the input interface and the session Id.
Delivering the PADT to the interface follows the normal rules. So, in
non-promiscuous mode, a non-multicast frame must have the correct
destination MAC address. In promiscuous mode, all frames are accepted.

Note that, as I already said in a previous message, actions on the
network interface used by PPPoE can also unregister the PPP channel
(passing the interface down, changing the MTU, etc.). That's why I
proposed to check the evolution of the PPPoE interface with rtmon.

I guess it was just because of the concurrent tcpdump running without
the -p option.
