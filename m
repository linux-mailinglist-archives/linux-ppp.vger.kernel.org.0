Just a quick follow up to say that it is all working fine after I 
upgraded to version 2.4.9 of pppd.

I had initially been using version 2.4.7, that came with Raspberry Pi OS 
(buster).
I had also been testing using git master of the ppp repo on the 'client'.

But I hadn't tried upgrading the 'server' (the peer configured with the 
interface identifiers).
After upgrading to 2.4.9 on the 'server' it works perfectly - even with 
an older version of pppd on the 'client'.
I haven't tracked down the commit that fixed it but I guess it was 
something to do with failing to Nack the random interface identifier 
sent by the peer.

Thank you for your help and thoughts on the issue.
