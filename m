That's really good evidence right there.  It certainly looks like the
Roaring Penguin PPPoE kernel driver is blindly accepting a bad PADT
packet meant for someone else.  Your peer probably shouldn't have sent
this down the line to you, but that's another matter.

I don't maintain the RP software, but I have a guess.  Either something
on the system is keeping the Ethernet driver itself in promiscuous mode,
or some defect in the driver allows non-matching non-multicast
destinations to be sent up the receive pipe.

Either way, it's usually responsibility of the receiving protocol
software after ethertype demux (in this case, the PPPoE implementation,
and NOT the PPP code) to validate that the addresses are correct when
necessary.  It's not the driver's problem.

I think the PPPoE code may be missing a check here.  This looks like a
bug to me.

I don't think this is causing the problem, but it's interesting evidence
nonetheless.  If the peer you're talking to actually implemented PPP in
a reasonable manner, it would send LCP Protocol-Reject in response to
your attempt to negotiate IPV6CP rather than just ignoring you.  The
peer isn't healthy.  Not much you can do about it at this point (other
than disabling IPv6 on your side with "noipv6"), but still interesting.

Yes, EXCEPT that pppd isn't involved at all.  PADT is part of the PPPoE
protocol, not PPP.  pppd doesn't know anything about this.  It's the
rp-pppoe software that's responding improperly.  As I suggested
previously in a private message, I think you should discuss the problem
with the maintainers of the PPPoE stuff.
